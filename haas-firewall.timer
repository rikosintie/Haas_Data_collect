# Haas Appliance - Daily Firewall Refresh Timer
#
# This systemd timer unit triggers the haas-firewall.service
# once per day to ensure the UFW configuration:
#   - Stays in sync with the CSV.
#   - Self-heals if someone changes rules manually.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#   - OnCalendar=daily  → runs at least once per day.
#   - Persistent=true   → catches up missed runs after downtime.
#
# The associated service is:
#   haas-firewall.service
