# Appendixes

This section provides technical deep dives and operational considerations that extend beyond basic installation of the Haas Data Collection Appliance.

In production environments—especially those managed by MSPs or security teams—details matter. File permissions, service configuration, and system hardening directly impact stability, security posture, and long-term maintainability. These appendixes document those details clearly and explicitly.

The material here is intended for administrators who want to understand not just how to deploy the appliance, but why it is configured the way it is.
